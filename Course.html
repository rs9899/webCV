• Zero Shot Learning in Scene Graph Generation Advanced Machine Learning , Spring 2019
Extended the Scene Graph generation to infinite vocabulary predicate by predicting the target
word-embeddings which can then be mapped to the closest word in the Embedding space.
• VQA : A CS763 Odyssey Computer Vision , Spring 2019
Worked on the existing Visual Question Answering using Deep Learning approach, adding improved
Word Embeddings and a side classifier to switch between modules for YES/NO answers and normal
answers.
• EDGE: Efficient Digital Grading Environment Database and Information Systems , Autumn 2018
End to End solution for Exam Conduction which given text by instructor, generates question paper in
LateX , assign scanned papers to Teaching Assistant for evaluation and provides scores to students.
• SPSIM: Superscalar Processor Simulator Computer Architecture , Autumn 2018
Built a MIPS Code Simulator from scratch in C++ following a real superscalar microprocessor architecture
adding features such as Out-of-order Execution and multiple Processing units for faster execution.
• Transfer Learning for Image Prior Medical Image Computing , Spring 2018
◦ Used ideas of Neural Style Transfer to generate image prior for denoising.
◦ Implemented method of Dictionary transfer for image denoising using K-SVD and matching pursuit.
• Railway Signalling Controller Digital Logic Design , Spring 2018
Programmed a Spartan FPGA Board in VHDL to work as a railway signalling controller along with
encrypting the communication between the boards.
• GetSchedGo Software Systems Laboratory, Autumn 2017
Developed a web time table scheduling application using Django with personalisations like events
suggestion, smart scheduling, course based events and syncing the result with the Google Calendar.
