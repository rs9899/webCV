3D Reconstruction in Cryogenic Electron Microscopy Ongoing
Research and Development Project under Prof. Ajit Rajwade
• Improving on the earlier work by adding an additional freedom of translation in the input data.
• Running the framework on real world data after proper denoising and contrast correction.
Auto Tuning Spark Applications on a Kubernetes cluster Autumn 2018
BTech Project under Prof. Umesh Bellur
• Developed a framework to output resource consumption for input set of configurational parameters.
• Generated more analytical data for further analysis in configurational parameters optimisation.
Neural Network for Image Processing Spring 2018
Research and Development Project under Prof. Suyash Awate
• Single image super-resolution using neural network following the ideas of EnhanceNet
• Experimented with conversion of images to sequence models for application of LSTM cells
